# Brain_Tumor_Detection'
In this project, I implemented the detection of brain tumor using Deeplearning algorithm, making use of artifical neural network. The data used is from Kaggle.\
In the building of the model I made use of both binary classification and categorical crossentropy.
The binary classification and the categorical crossentropy were tested after iterating for about 10 epoch and they gave very accurate result.
